## Introduction

The **Fibonacci Calculator** is a Java-based application designed to compute Fibonacci numbers using different techniques. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.

---

## Features

- **Iterative Approach**: Calculates Fibonacci numbers using loops for optimal performance.
- **Recursive Approach**: A classical approach using recursion.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Uses memoization to improve the recursive approach's efficiency.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Accepts user input via the terminal for quick Fibonacci calculations.
- **Custom Input**: Allows users to input any positive integer to calculate the corresponding Fibonacci number.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java (JDK 11 or higher)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-compatible IDE
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle (Optional)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Fibonacci Calculator locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Agrawalers/Fibonacci-Calculator.git
   cd Fibonacci-Calculator
   ```

2. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   javac FibonacciCalculator.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   java FibonacciCalculator
   ```

---

## Usage

Once the program is running, you can interact with it by providing an integer input to calculate the Fibonacci number.

### Example:
```bash
Enter a number to calculate Fibonacci: 10
Iterative Result: 55
Recursive Result: 55
Dynamic Programming Result: 55
```
